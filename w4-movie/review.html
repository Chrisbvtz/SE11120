        <p>An utter masterpiece! A proper adventure dealing with lots of themes such as greed, duality, loneliness, environmentalism, and growth. Although truth be told, the film was so marvellous that I stopped caring about meaning and just basked in it. The film is so dense with magical and fantastical imagery and ideas it was mesmerising. Every scene had something new and exciting or interesting to look at or hear, and it all looked gorgeous. I think this is the peak of design and animation for Miyazaki and Co. It was so full of colour and so smoothly drawn without looking CGI. I found the design and character of No-Face especially compelling. The film is over two hours, but paced perfectly, and it never drags; all leading to a satisfying reveal and conclusion. The idea of the gossamer-thin veil between our reality and the spirit world, as well as natural things like rivers and great trees having deity like spirits of their own hearkens back to Animism and Druidism and ancient folklore which I enjoyed. The music is in great form too. Hisaishi's recurring piano motif is stirring, and it has a strong score that takes you on the journey. </p>
    <p><em>Spirited Away</em> is a coming-of-age fantasy film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It follows a young girl named Chihiro who becomes trapped in a mysterious and magical world filled with spirits, gods, and creatures after her parents are transformed into pigs. To save her family, she must work in a bathhouse run by a witch and learn the value of courage, love, and identity.<p>
